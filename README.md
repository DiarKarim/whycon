Description
==========

_WhyCon_ is a vision-based localization system that can be used with low-cost web cameras, and achieves millimiter precision with very high-performance.
These characteristics allow it to be used as an alternative to more expensive systems available for research communities.

Ease of use and setup are also important features of this software. Also, this software could eventually be included in the OpenCV library for ease of usage for software developers which may require access to the internals of this system.

Status
=====

_WhyCon_ was first presented on ICRA2013 conference and will be published as a Journal article soon. 
This code is to be updated during May/2013 to include latest developments (mainly, homography based calibration) and will be accompanied with a manual.
